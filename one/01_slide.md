# So You're Bitter #

* But I have a point
* Over focusing on start-ups generates some bad attitudes

# How so, Old man? #

* Get off my lawn
* Isn't the point of a start-up to get to profitability?
* Isn't the point of all these Principle, Patterns, and Practices to get to an unsurprising code base?

# I guess... What's your point? #

* I'm doing all this hard work to make money and make our code base awesome
* But then we're not a start up anymore
* 40 hours (really), profitable, things work, and...
* No excitement?

## There's a zero chance of getting rich quick at Backstop ##

* Hold on, aren't the titles supposed to be pretend questions from the audience?
* Not now, voices in my head
* Here's the point: We say we care about profitability, learning, sustainable pace, stability, testing, and well factored code...
* So why is it so hard to keep everyone from running to a start-up?
